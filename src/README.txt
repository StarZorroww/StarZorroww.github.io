This website was made in Visual Studio Code, and tested / debugged in Google Chrome. This website works
best in Microsoft Edge, as Google Chrome does not allow autoplaying sound. This website contains 6 photo-
shopped images in the portfolio, an about me page, a beer slider (before and after slider), and a contact page.
There is also a hidden page which is accessible by opening "hidden.html", or from "index.html".
